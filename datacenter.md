## DataCenter.2b

DuPont Fabros Technology (Digital Reality) has one big data center in
Ashbur, Virginia. With 2.1 million sq.ft area and 10500 servers, this is
one of the biggest data centers. This can run yearly capacity of the 200
MWatts. The data center features a calculated annualized Power Usage
Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15 by virtue of a highly efficient cooling
plant and medium voltage oil-filled PDUs (power distribution units).
These data points (reference below) combined with Schnider Electric Data
Center Carbon Footprint Calculator,  Yearly Cost, Yearly CO2 and Yearly
Equivalent CO2 in cars could be computed.

I have computed my own carbon foot print using the [CarbonFootPrint Calculator](http://carbonfootprint.c2es.org/).
Taking into account, my family's daily car travel of 10 miles and my air travel 
trips yearly (10 short and 2 long), the yearly carbon foot print assuming my
residential area in Santa Clara- comes to 7939 lbs. 
However, since I actually reside in India, I decided to use [another calculator](https://www.icicibank.com/go-green/carbon-world-day/indexef62.html)
which is specific for India. Using the calculator, my carbon foot print comes to 
7187 lbs (3.26 tonnes).
Currently, I have reported the first value in the spreadsheet on google drive.

According to Wikipedia: 
Renewable thermal energy is the technology of gathering thermal energy from a
 renewable energy source for immediate use or for storage in a thermal battery 
for later use. The most popular form of renewable thermal energy is the sun and 
the solar energy is harvested by solar collectors to heat water, buildings, 
pools and various processes.  

Another example of Renewable Thermal is a 
Geothermal or ground source Heat Pump (GHP) system, where thermal stored 
in the ground from the summer is extracted from the ground to heat a building 
in another season. This example system is "renewable" because the source of 
excess heat energy is a reliably recurring  process that occurs each summer season.

One way data centers can make use of Renewable Thermal Energy is by using
Geothermal cooling systems. Geothermal cooling systems include an array of v
ertical holes drilled into the earth’s surface that house a closed-loop piping 
system filled with water and/or coolant. The cool temperatures underground 
allows the piping system to serve as a heat exchanger.

Some examples of data centers using GeoThermal Energy include:

Renewable Energy in China

China has done tremendous investment in Renewable Energy forms and it's utilization.
China has currently taken lead in renewable energy and is world's largest producer,
exporter and installer of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries etc.
China renewable energy sector is growing faster than fossil or nucelar power capacity. 
China sees renewables as a energy security rather than only for reduction carbon
emission. However, inspite of being leader in renewables, only a quarter of the actual 
electricity is currently happening from renewables. 

Hydro Power in China:Hydroelectricity is currently China's largest renewable energy source.
At the same the big dams have caused environmental damages as well. 

Wind Power in China: China has set goal for 15% all elecricity from renewables by 2020.
With really big coastline, China has exceptional wind power resources. China is leading 
windpower generation. There are research estimate that China could meet all of their 
electricity demands through wind. 

Solar Power in China: China is world's largest market for solar thermal energy and 
photovoltaics. Solar water heating also is extensively used. There is a concern though,
because the byproduct of first generation solar cells - silicon tetrachloride,  can have 
environmental impact, due to in-suffecient recycling.


With Chinese government providing subsidies as well as creating the policies, China 
is bound to continue it's leadership position in Renewable Energy.

## DataCenter.8

On January 24th and 25th 2019, the  online productivity suite experienced multiple 
outage issues throughout the last two days, with users reporting that they couldn't
 access their mailboxes through multiple protocol. Furthermore, some user reports 
also mentioned slow e-mail sending and receiving (with more than 3-hour delays), 
missing e-mails, as well as sending or receiving multiple repeated e-mails at one time.

Impact was USA, UK, France

The problem was due to a subset of Domain Controller Infrastructure becoming
un-responsive, resulting in user connection timeouts. Microsoft later blamed
DNS provider CenturyLink which acknowledged a software defect affecting 
connectivity to customer's cloud resources.
