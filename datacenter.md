## DataCenter 2.b

DuPont Fabros Technology (Digital Reality) has one big data center in
Ashbur, Virginia. With 2.1 million sq.ft area and 10500 servers, this is
one of the biggest data centers. This can run yearly capacity of the 200
MWatts. The data center features a calculated annualized Power Usage
Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15 by virtue of a highly efficient cooling
plant and medium voltage oil-filled PDUs (power distribution units).
These data points (reference below) combined with Schnider Electric Data
Center Carbon Footprint Calculator,  Yearly Cost, Yearly CO2 and Yearly
Equivalent CO2 in cars could be computed.

I have computed my own carbon foot print using the [CarbonFootPrint Calculator](http://carbonfootprint.c2es.org/).
Taking into account, my family's daily car travel of 10 miles and my air travel 
trips yearly (10 short and 2 long), the yearly carbon foot print assuming my
residential area in Santa Clara- comes to 7939 lbs. 
However, since I actually reside in India, I decided to use [another calculator](https://www.icicibank.com/go-green/carbon-world-day/indexef62.html)
which is specific for India. Using the calculator, my carbon foot print comes to 
7187 lbs (3.26 tonnes).
Currently, I have reported the first value in the spreadsheet on google drive.

According to Wikipedia: 
Renewable thermal energy is the technology of gathering thermal energy from a
 renewable energy source for immediate use or for storage in a thermal battery 
for later use. The most popular form of renewable thermal energy is the sun and 
the solar energy is harvested by solar collectors to heat water, buildings, 
pools and various processes.  Another example of Renewable Thermal is a 
Geothermal or ground source Heat Pump (GHP) system, where thermal stored 
in the ground from the summer is extracted from the ground to heat a building 
in another season. This example system is "renewable" because the source of 
excess heat energy is a reliably recurring  process that occurs each summer season.

One way data centers can make use of Renewable Thermal Energy is by using
Geothermal cooling systems. Geothermal cooling systems include an array of v
ertical holes drilled into the earth’s surface that house a closed-loop piping 
system filled with water and/or coolant. The cool temperatures underground 
allows the piping system to serve as a heat exchanger.

Some examples of data centers using GeoThermal Energy include:
