## DataCenter 2.b

DuPont Fabros Technology (Digital Reality) has one big data center in
Ashbur, Virginia. With 2.1 million sq.ft area and 10500 servers, this is
one of the biggest data centers. This can run yearly capacity of the 200
MWatts. The data center features a calculated annualized Power Usage
Effectiveness (PUE) of 1.15 by virtue of a highly efficient cooling
plant and medium voltage oil-filled PDUs (power distribution units).
These data points (reference below) combined with Schnider Electric Data
Center Carbon Footprint Calculator,  Yearly Cost, Yearly CO2 and Yearly
Equivalent CO2 in cars could be computed.

## DataCenter 3.0
I have computed my own carbon foot print using the CarbonFootPrint Calculator(http://carbonfootprint.c2es.org/).
Taking into account, my family's daily car travel of 10 miles and my air travel 
trips yearly (10 short and 2 long), the yearly carbon foot print assuming my
residential area in Santa Clara- comes to 7939 lbs. 
However, since I actually reside in India, i decided to use another calculator(https://www.icicibank.com/go-green/carbon-world-day/indexef62.html)
which is specific for India. Using the calculator, my carbon foot print comes to 
7187 lbs (3.26 tonnes).
